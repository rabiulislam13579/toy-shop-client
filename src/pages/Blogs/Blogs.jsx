            <h2>1.What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?
            </h2>
            <p>Access Token: <br />
                An access token is a credential used to access protected resources or perform authorized actions on behalf of a user. It plays a crucial role in authentication and authorization systems. When a user successfully authenticates and authorizes an application, an access token is issued by an authentication server. <br />

                The access token contains information about the user's identity and permissions. It serves as proof that the user has been authenticated and authorized to access certain resources or perform specific actions. This token is typically time-limited and has an expiration period, ensuring that it is only valid for a certain duration. <br />

                To use an access token, the client application includes it in API requests as a part of the request headers or as a parameter. When the server receives a request with an access token, it validates the token's authenticity and checks the associated permissions. If the token is valid and the user has the required permissions, the server processes the request and returns the appropriate response. <br />
                Refresh Token: <br />
                A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires. It is commonly used in systems where access tokens have a limited lifespan. The purpose of the refresh token is to prevent users from having to re-authenticate every time an access token expires. <br />

                When a user successfully authenticates and authorizes an application, along with the access token, a refresh token is issued by the authentication server. Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens have a longer lifespan. The client application securely stores the refresh token. <br />

                When the access token expires, the client application sends a request to the authentication server with the refresh token. If the refresh token is valid and not expired, the server issues a new access token. This process allows the client application to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials. <br />

                The use of refresh tokens enhances user experience by reducing the frequency of login prompts. It also provides an additional layer of security since the access token's lifespan is limited, reducing the impact of token leakage or unauthorized use.

            <h2>2.Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</h2>
            <p>SQL databases follow a structured, predefined schema with relational structures and enforce a fixed schema for data. They are vertically scalable and excel in providing ACID transactions for maintaining data integrity. On the other hand, NoSQL databases embrace flexibility with schema-less designs, allowing for agile development and accommodating unstructured or evolving data. They scale horizontally, distributing data across multiple servers, and are highly scalable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads. NoSQL databases use various data models and may have their own query languages tailored to their data model, providing a different approach to querying and manipulating data compared to the standardized SQL language used in SQL databases.</p>
            <h2>3. What is express js? What is Nest JS ?</h2>
            <p>Express.js: <br />
Express.js is a minimalist and flexible web framework for Node.js, designed to make building web applications and APIs easier. It provides a straightforward and unopinionated approach, allowing developers to have more control over their application's architecture. With Express.js, developers can define routes, handle HTTP requests and responses, and implement middleware for request processing. It offers a simple and intuitive API for routing and handling different HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Express.js is widely used and has a large ecosystem of middleware and extensions available, making it highly customizable and adaptable to various application requirements. Its lightweight nature and performance efficiency make it suitable for building small to medium-sized applications or microservices. <br />

Nest.js: <br />
Nest.js is a progressive and opinionated web application framework built on top of Node.js and TypeScript. It takes inspiration from Angular's architecture and design patterns, promoting modularity, scalability, and code reusability. Nest.js follows a modular structure based on modules, controllers, and services, enabling developers to organize their code into logical components. It leverages decorators and TypeScript's strong typing to provide dependency injection, metadata-driven programming, and robust development tools. Nest.js supports various transport layers such as HTTP, WebSockets, and Microservices, making it suitable for building both traditional web applications and real-time applications. It also integrates well with other libraries and frameworks, allowing developers to leverage the existing Node.js ecosystem. Nest.js promotes best practices and conventions, making it a suitable choice for larger-scale applications with complex business logic or multi-team development environments.</p>
<h2>4. What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work ?</h2>
<p>
MongoDB's aggregate is a powerful framework that allows for data processing and transformation in the MongoDB database. It enables users to perform complex operations on collections of documents, including filtering, grouping, sorting, joining, and computing aggregations. The aggregate framework utilizes a pipeline approach, where multiple stages are defined and executed in a sequence to process the data.</p>
